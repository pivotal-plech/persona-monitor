# Persona Monitor

## Problem Statement

Product, Engineering and Design at PCF are working together with the goal of helping the enterprise push apps to the cloud. As PCF has become larger we have more distributed teams collaborating.

It's difficult for distributed teams to share a common understanding of the human beings we're building for.

How might we improve the shared understanding of the mortal coil we're building for.

## Goals

## Proto Personas (Meta Right?)

We're building this product teams at PCF.

### Pivotal Designer
"I don't want to dig through google drive to share out artifacts"

### Pain Points
Having to explain what a persona is like 20 times a day
Duplicating work across multiple products

### Goals
Advocate for the right user

### Pivotal Engineer
#### Quotes
"we think that enterprise developers have this struggle, but we don't know"
"I just want to do my job more effectively."

#### Goals
Push back on feature creep
More effective ways of prioritizing features
We keep accidentally gravitating to these peoples needs
This user might be relevant over here
This user is not relevant to us

#### Pain points
It's hard to prioritize features when there's an infinite requests coming through
Feature requests. WTF.
Product Team isn't empowered to tell people say no

### Pivotal PM
As a product manager 
I want a way to link to a persona as a motivation for each 
so that everyone shares the context of why we're building a feature

#### Pain Points
Team is constantly having to go to different resources

#### Product Directors
Assumptions

#### Goals
Consistent view of who we're building for across PCF
